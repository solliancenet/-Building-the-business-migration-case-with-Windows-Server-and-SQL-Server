# Building the business migration case with Windows Server and SQL Server

Tailspin Toys is a global manufacturer of childrenâ€™s toys that was founded in 1957 with its global headquarters located in Milwaukee, WI. Their mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and they are beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

During the Envision Workshop, Kaylee Frye, CTO of Tailspin Toys, saw the value of digital transformation, adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud, and modernizing their infrastructure. She has already had the Technical Architects at Tailspin Toys begin assessing their current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing technical debt, streamlining operations, and simplifying their DevOps workflow. According to Kaylee Frye, "Our development teams have already begun adopting DevOps strategies and implemented CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) pipelines with Azure DevOps. We really look forward to better streamlining IT operations as we adopt Microsoft Azure for the infrastructure too."

### Workshop

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn to design a strategy for migrating existing on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the virtual machine (VM) pricing, integrated management of cloud, and on-premises workloads using Azure Arc, and migrating SQL Server workloads to Azure.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design a migration strategy for Windows Server workloads to Azure VMs, SQL Server workloads to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), and simplify workload management using Azure Arc.
