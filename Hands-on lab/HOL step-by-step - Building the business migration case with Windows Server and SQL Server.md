# Building the business migration case with Windows Server and SQL Server hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Windows Server VM, migrating a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), and Azure Arc-enable an on-premises Windows Server VM.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will perform steps toward migrating Tailspin Toy's on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. Tailspin needs a new Windows Server VM created in Azure for hosting their Web application, an on-premises SQL Server database migrated to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and an on-premises Windows Server VM to be Azure Arc-enabled.

Tailspin already has a Hub and Spoke network setup in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will be deployed into this environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Windows Server for application migration to Azure, migrate an on-premises SQL Database to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Arc-enable an on-premises virtual machine so it can be managed from Azure.

## Solution architecture

![Diagram showing on-premises network connected to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke network in Azure.

The diagram shows an on-premise network connected to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke network in Azure. The Spoke VNet contains the migrated Front-end, Back-end, and SQL Database workloads running within Subnets inside the Spoke VNet in Azure.

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: SQL database migration

Duration: 90 minutes

Tailspin Toys needs to migrate their on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. This is part of the migration strategy defined to migrate Tailspin Toys workloads to Azure.

In this exercise, you will go through the steps necessary to migrate Tailspin Toys' on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

### Task 1: Create subnet and storage account for Azure SQL MI

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab setup.

2. Within the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group created for this lab, and go to the `tailspin-spoke-vnet` virtual network.

3. Under **Settings**, select the **Subnets** link.
