# Building the business migration case with Windows Server and SQL Server hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Windows Server VM, migrating SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), and Azure Arc-enable an on-premises Windows Server VM.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will perform steps towards migrating Tailspin Toys on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server workloads to Azure. Tailspin needs a new Windows Server VM created in Azure for hosting their Web application, a on-premises SQL Server database migrated to Azure SQL Managed Instance, and an on-premises Windows Server VM to be Azure Arc-enabled.

Tailspin already has a Hub and Spoke network setup in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will be deployed into this environment.

## Solution architecture

![Preferred Solution Diagram](images/PreferredSolutionDiagram.png "Diagram showing on-premises network connected to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke network in Azure. The Spoke VNet contains the migrated Front-end, Back-end, and SQL Database workloads running within Subnets inside the Spoke VNet in Azure.")

The diagram shows on-premises network connected to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute with a Hub and Spoke network in Azure. The Spoke VNet contains the migrated Front-end, Back-end, and SQL Database workloads running within Subnets inside the Spoke VNet in Azure.

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: SQL Database Migration

Duration: 90 minutes

Tailspin Toys needs to migrate their on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. This is part of the migration strategy defines to migrate Tailspin Toys workloads to Azure.

In this exercise, you will go through the steps necessary to migrate Tailspin Toys on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

### Task 1: Create Subnet and Storage Account for Azure SQL MI

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab setup.

2. Within the Azure Portal, navigate to Resource Group created for this lab, and go to the `tailspin-spoke-vnet` virtual network.

3. Under **Settings**, select the **Subnets** link.

    ![Subnets link highlighted on the tailspin-spoke-vnet pane](images/azure-sql-mi-spoke-vnet-subnets-link.png "Subnets link highlighted on the tailspin-spoke-vnet pane")

    > **Note**: The Azure Bastion instance named `tailspin-hub-bastion` was previously created with the Before the Hands-on lab setup. This is a required resource for using Azure Bastion to securely connect to Azure VMs using RDP from within the Azure Portal.

4. A new browser tab will open with Azure Bastion connected to the virtual machine over RDP. To close this session, you can close this browser tab.

    ![Browser window open with Azure Bastion connected to the VM](images/browser-azure-bastion-connected-web-app-win2022server.png "Browser window open with Azure Bastion connected to the VM")

> **Note**: Now that the Windows Server 2022 VM has been created in Azure, Tailspin Toys will now be able to modify their Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CD/CD) pipelines within Azure DevOps to begin deploying the Web Application code to this virtual machine as they get ready for migrating the application to Azure.

## Exercise 3: Azure Arc-enable On-premises VM

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will Azure Arc-enable a Windows Server VM that Tailspin has on-premises. This VM is being Arc-enabled since there are no plans to migrate it to Azure, but Tailspin would like to simplify the management of all their VMs in a single place. Azure Arc provides the functionality to manage Azure and on-premises VMs in a single place giving Tailspin Toys exactly what they are looking to simplify VM management and administration.

### Task 1: Generate Azure Arc script to add server

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab setup.

2. In the **Search resources, services, and docs** box at the top of the portal, search for **Azure Arc**, then select the **Azure Arc** service.

    ![Azure Portal search for Azure Arc with 'Azure Arc' option highlighted](images/azure-portal-search-azure-arc-service.png "Azure Portal search for Azure Arc with 'Azure Arc' option highlighted")

3. On the **Azure Arc** pane, select the **Infrastructure** tab, then select the **Add** button under **Servers**.

    ![Azure Arc pane with Infrastructure tab and Servers Add button highlighted](images/azure-arc-pane-infrastructure-servers-add-button.png "Azure Arc pane with Infrastructure tab and Servers Add button highlighted")

4. Under **Add a single server** select **Generate script**.

5. On the **Add a server with Azure Arc** pane, read the requirements of Azure Arc that are listed, then select **Next**.

6. On the **Resource details** tab, enter the following values, then select **Next**.

    - **Resource group**: Select the Resource Group created for this lab. For example: `tailspin-rg`
