## Exercise 1: Create VM to Migrate Web Application

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a new Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) that will be the destination for migrating the on-premises Web Application to Azure, and then you will use Azure Bastion to connect to the VM over Remote Desktop (RDP). Azure Bastion will allow secure remoting to the VM for Administrators.

### Task 1: Create Windows Server 2022 VM

In this task, you will create a new Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) that will be the destination for migrating the on-premises Web Application to Azure.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab setup.

2. On the **Home** page within the Azure Portal, towards the top, select **Create a resource**.

3. Within the **Search services and marketplace** field, type **Windows Server** and press Enter to search the marketplace.

4. Select **Windows Server**.

    ![Windows Server is highlighted within the Azure Marketplace](images/azure-marketplace-windows-server.png "Windows Server is highlighted")

5. Choose **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter**, then select **Create**.

6. On the **Create a virtual machine** pane, set the following values to configure the new virtual machine:

    - **Resource Group**: Select the resource group that you created fro this lab. Such as `tailspin-rg`.
    - **Virtual machine name**: Give the VM a unique name, such as `tailspin-webapp-vm`
    - **Region**: Select the Azure Region that was used to create the resource group
    - **Image**: Verify the image is set to **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter**

    ![Create a virtual machine with field set](images/create-virtual-machine-windows-server-image-set.png "Create a virtual machine with field set")

7. Set the **Size** field select the **Standard_D4s_v5** virtual machine size.

    ![VM size is set](images/create-virtual-machine-size-set.png "VM size is set")

8. Set a **Username** and **Password** for the **Administrator account** for the VM.

    > **Note**: Be sure to save the Username and Password for the VM, so it can be used later. Recommendation for easy to remember Username is `demouser` and Password is `demo!pass123`.

9. Select **Next** until you are navigated to the **Networking** tab of the ** Create a virtual machine page.

    ![Networking tab is selected](images/create-virtual-machine-networking-tab-selected.png "Networking tab is selected")

10. Provision the VM in the Spoke VNet in Azure by selecting the following values under the **Network interface** section:

    - **Virtual network**: Select the Spoke VNet that was created for this lab. It's name will be silimar to `tailspin-spoke-vnet`
    - **Subnet**: `default`
    - **Public IP**: `None`

    ![Virtual Network, Subnet, and Public IP values are set](images/create-virtual-machine-networking-values-set.png "Virtual Network, Subnet, and Public IP values are set")

11. Set the following values to ensure that HTTPS traffic will be allowed to connect to the VM:

    - **Public inbound ports**: `Allow selected ports`
    - **Select inbound ports**: `HTTPS (443)`

    ![Networking inbound ports set to allow HTTPS traffic](images/create-virtual-network-https-traffic-allowed.png "Networking inbound ports set to allow HTTPS traffic")

12. Select **Review + create** to review the virtual machine settings.

13. Select **Create** to begin provisioning the virtual machine.

### Task 2: Check Remote Desktop Access

In this task, you will test Remote Desktop (RDP) connectivity to the newly created virtual machine using Azure Bastion.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the newly created **Virtual Machine**.

    ![Virtual machine pane is open](images/web-app-win2022server-virtual-machine-pane.png "Virtual machine pane is open")

2. On the left, under the **Operations** section, select **Bastion**.

    ![Bastion is highlighted under Operations section](images/portal-virtual-machine-operations-bastion-link.png "Bastion is highlighted under Operations section")

3. On the **Bastion** pane, enter the **Username** and **Password** that was set for the Administrator User of the VM when it was created, then select **Connect**

    ![Bastion pane with username and password entered](images/portal-virtual-machine-operations-bastion-pane.png "Bastion pane with username and password entered")

    > **Note**: The Azure Bastion instance named `tailspin-hub-bastion` was previously created with the Before the Hands-on lab setup. This is a required resource for using Azure Bastion to securely connect to Azure VMs using RDP from within the Azure Portal.

4. A new browser tab will open with Azure Bastion connected to the virtual machine over RDP. To close this session, you can close this browser tab.
